Diabetes Prediction Console Application : 

This is a Python-based console application that uses machine learning to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific symptoms. Using prior data stored in a CSV file, the app processes input data and provides a prediction. The project also includes a simple GUI interface created with tkinter.

Features
Machine Learning: Implements a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict diabetes based on input symptoms.
Data Analysis: Reads and processes data from a CSV file with pandas and numpy.
Simple GUI: Uses tkinter to provide an interactive user interface.
Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 installed. Install the required dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure that requirements.txt includes pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tkinter, and any other dependencies used in the project.

Usage
Run the main script from your console:

python diabetes_formatted.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to input patient symptoms.

View the prediction results displayed in the console and GUI.

Project Structure
diabetes_formatted.py: Main application script, including the machine learning model, data processing, and GUI code.
data/diabetes_data.csv: Historical data used to train the model (ensure this file is in the specified path).
